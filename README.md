🎵 Music Data Analysis using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes music track data using Python to understand trends and patterns in song features such as popularity, energy, loudness, acousticness, and duration.
Basic data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques are applied using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

📂 Dataset

tracks.csv

Contains song-level information such as:

Popularity

Energy

Loudness

Acousticness

Duration

Release Year

Only the tracks.csv file is used to keep the analysis simple and clear.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

🔄 Steps Followed
1️⃣ Data Import

Uploaded the dataset using Google Colab

Loaded the data using Pandas

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed missing values

Removed duplicate records

3️⃣ Data Analysis

Performed basic statistical analysis

Checked correlations between song features

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Created a bar chart to show the number of songs released per year

Used simple plots to understand trends

📊 Visualization Example
Bar Chart – Number of Songs Released per Year

This chart shows how music production has changed over time by counting the number of songs released each year.

🔍 Key Insights

Music production varies significantly across years

Audio features such as energy and loudness show relationships with popularity

Song duration shows changing trends over time

▶️ How to Run the Project

Open Google Colab

Upload tracks.csv

Run the Python cells step by step

🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for simple yet effective data analysis and visualization.
The focus is on clarity, correctness, and easy interpretation of results.
